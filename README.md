# Increment Decrement Project

## Overview

This project is designed to enhance your understanding of the `useState` hook in React. The `useState` hook is a fundamental part of React that allows you to manage and update state within functional components.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to:

1. **Learn `useState`:** Gain a deep understanding of how the `useState` hook works and how it can be used to manage state in React functional components.

2. **Hands-on Practice:** Apply your knowledge by building a simple increment and decrement application that demonstrates the practical use of `useState`.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the necessary dependencies.

3. **Run the Application:** Start the development server by running `npm start` or `yarn start`. This will launch the application in your default web browser.

## Project Structure

The project has a simple structure:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
- `App.js`: The main application component where you will implement the increment and decrement logic.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the components.

## Implementation

In the `App.js` file, you'll find the initial setup of the `useState` hook. Your task is to complete the implementation to make the increment and decrement buttons functional.

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  let [counter, setCounter] = useState(15);
  let increment = () => {
    if (counter < 20) {
      setCounter(counter + 1);
    }
  };

  let decrement = () => {
    if (counter > 0) {
      setCounter(counter - 1);
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Counter Value: {counter}</h2>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment Value</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement Value</button>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;


```

## Learning Goals

By working on this project, you will:

- Gain practical experience with the `useState` hook.
- Understand how to manage and update state in React functional components.
- Enhance your overall proficiency in React development.

## Resources

If you need additional guidance on using the `useState` hook or React in general, consider referring to the official React documentation (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).

Happy coding!
